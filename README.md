Example files for CSV, XML, and Drop Folder bulk ingests

This repo serves provide sample files that can be used as reference when performing bulk ingest actions in Kaltura, either via CSV or XML in the KMC, or via Drop Folders.  Feel free to use these references and adjust to meet your needs.  If you run into something that is not working, feel free to open an issue and we will look into it.
